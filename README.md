## Country Info Explorer

Country Info Explorer is an Admin Dashboard built with VueJs and Vuetify which displays country information. 
Feel free to click each record in the table to get more country information with ability to see the country in the integrated google maps. Click on each header to see the table sort itself in ascending or descending order. Try out the Export to CSV button to get the table data in a CSV format in your own device. Search your favorite country and region in the search field to see your country or region get filtered in the table in front of you.
